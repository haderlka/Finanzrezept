The expected return after inflation is $r = 5\%$ per year. The compound interest formula is:
$$A = P(1 + r)^t$$
where:
- $A$ is the final amount
- $P$ is the principal (initial amount)
- $r$ is the annual interest rate
- $t$ is the time in years

The compound interest formula is:
$$A = P(1 + r)^t$$

Here's a simple formula: $E = mc^2$

And a more complex one:
$$
\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1}
$$
